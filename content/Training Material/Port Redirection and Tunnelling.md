>**Aim**
>Firewalls are commonly used to limit the flow into or out from a network. Most firewalls tend to filter traffic based on IP addresses and port numbers, but some monitor the traffic content as well. **Port redirection** and **tunnelling** help overcome firewalls.
>
>---
>
>**Port redirection**
>Port redirection means changing the flow of data so that packets sent to one socket will be reverted to another socket.
>
>---
>
>**Tunnelling**
>Tunnelling means encapsulating one type of data within another. Eg, transporting HTTP traffic within a SSH connection (so externally it seems to only be SSH traffic).

### SSH

>[!info]- Info - SSH for tunnelling
>_Secure Shell_ (SSH) is a tunnelling protocol, which is specifically designed to encapsulate data. Tunnelling data through an SSH connection is often referred to asÂ _SSH port forwarding_.
#### SSH Local Port Forwarding

>[!info]- Info - Port forwarding
>Packets are not forwarded by the same host that listens for packets (like seen with Socat port forwarding). Instead, an SSH connection is setup between two hosts (an SSH client and an SSH server), a listening port is opened by the _SSH client_, and then all packets received on this port are _tunnelled through the SSH connection_ to the _SSH server_. The packets are then forwarded by the SSH server to the socket we specify.

>[!info]- Setup
>We have access to CONFLUENCE01 and PGDATABASE01 and now find another host with a SMB server open, on TCP port 445. We want to connect to that SMB server via CONFLUENCE01 and PGDATABASE01.

>>And the output we get from the standard SSH session isn't sufficient to troubleshoot it, we can pass the **-v** flag to *ssh* in order to receive debug output.
#### SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding

>[!info]- Info - Dynamic vs local port forwarding
>Local port forwarding limits you to only one socket per SSH connection. _Dynamic port forwarding_ lets you forward to any socket that the SSH server host has access to, from a single listening port on the SSH client.
>
>It works because the listening port that the SSH client creates is a _SOCKS_ proxy server port.

>[!info]- Info - SOCKS and Proxychains
>**SOCKS**
>SOCKS is a proxying protocol. Like a postal service, a SOCKS server accepts packets (with a SOCKS protocol header) and forwards them on to wherever they're addressed.
>
>---
>
>**Proxychains**
>Proxychains is a tool that can force network traffic from third party tools over HTTP or SOCKS proxies. It can also be configured to push traffic over a _chain_ of concurrent proxies.
>
>>[!warning] Proxychains won't work in every situation
>>It will work for most _dynamically linked_ binaries that perform simple network operations; it won't work on _statically-linked_ binaries.

>

#### SSH Remote Port Forwarding

>[!info]- Info - Remote vs Local (Firewalls)
>Local port forwarding or dynamic port forwarding is possible because we can connect to any port on CONFLUENCE01. In the real word, however, firewalls often get in the way.
>
>**Outbound traffic is more likely to be accepted by firewalls than inbound**.
>
>Particularly, _inbound_ traffic is much more aggressively controlled than _outbound_ traffic. (It's unlikely we could SSH _into_ a network but much more likely we could SSH _out_ of a network.)
>
>SSH _remote port forwarding_ causes the SSH connection to connect back to an attacker-controlled SSH server and bind the listening port there.
>

>1. We will run a Chisel server on Kali, which will accept a connection from a Chisel client running on CONFLUENCE01.
>2. Chisel will bind a SOCKS proxy port on Kali.
>3. The Chisel server will encapsulate whatever we send through the SOCKS port and push it through the HTTP tunnel, SSH-encrypted.
>4. The Chisel client will then decapsulate and push the received traffic to wherever it is addressed.

>[!code]- Set up the Chisel server<br>`chisel server --port 8080 --reverse`
>- `--port 8080` listen on port 8080
>- `--reverse` allow reverse port forwarding

>[!code]- Set up the Chisel client<br>`client 192.168.118.4:8080 R:socks > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
>- `192.168.118.4:8080` connect to the Chisel server socket on Kali
>- `R:socks` create a reverse (_R_) SOCKS (_socks_) tunnel (which is bound to port 1080 by default)
>- `> /dev/null 2>&1 &` redirect shell output to force the process to run in the background and free up our shell

>[!code]- SSH via the Chisel tunnel<br>`ssh -o ProxyCommand='ncat --proxy-type socks5 --proxy 127.0.0.1:1080 %h %p' database_admin@10.4.50.215`
>- `-o ProxyCommand` accepts a shell command that opens a proxy-enabled channel
>	- Ncat supports proxying whereas nc does not (may need to install ncat)
